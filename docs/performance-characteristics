Performance characteristics 
============================
The high-speed portions of the timetagger and sequencer are driven from a clock
generated from the external crystal on the Xylo board. It is recommended that a
32.000 MHz crystal is used here. The acquisition and sequencer clock is then
generated by the FPGA's PLL with a 4x multiplication, resulting in a 128 MHz
clock. This ultimately determines the timing resolution of the sequencer and
event tagger.

The maximum event rate supported by the event tagger is determined by several
factors. Obviously, more than one input event during a single clock cycle will
generate only one event record. Beyond this, the event rate is limited by the
bandwidth of the USB bus. Data is sent from the tagger to the host PC over USB
(assuming the bus is operating in USB 2 high speed mode) in packets of at most
512 bytes (85 records). These packets are sent at most once every 125
microseconds. This leads to a maximum steady-state transfer rate of 680k
events/second.

While USB bandwidth limits the steady-state throughput there are several
intermediate FIFOs which can absorb short bursts of high event rates. The
tagger's sample_fifo holds 2048 records and can be filled at the acquisition
clockrate.  Events incoming while this FIFO is full will produce a lost_sample
flag in the next event successfully recorded.

Events in the sample_fifo are usually clocked out to the FX2 USB interface at
the rate of 30MHz / 6 = 5 MHz. The timetag-fx2 firmware configures three of the
FX2's 512-byte FIFO buffers to accept event data.
