Register interface:
====================

The device is controlled using a simple register interface. Register addresses
are 16-bits long whereas values are 32-bits. Registers are manipulated with the
read and write commands written on the control endpoint (endpoint 8). In both
cases the register value is written back on the reply endpoint (endpoint 2).

register read:
  byte 0        0xAA
  byte 1        0x00
  byte 2        Register address, bits 7:0
  byte 3        Register address, bits 15:8
  byte 4        0x00
  byte 5        0x00
  byte 6        0x00
  byte 7        0x00

register write:
  byte 0        0xAA
  byte 1        0x01
  byte 2        Register address, bits 7:0
  byte 3        Register address, bits 15:8
  byte 4        Register value, bits 7:0
  byte 5        Register value, bits 15:8
  byte 6        Register value, bits 23:16
  byte 7        Register value, bits 31:24

response:
  byte 0        Register value, bits 7:0
  byte 1        Register value, bits 15:8
  byte 2        Register value, bits 23:16
  byte 3        Register value, bits 31:24


Register descriptions:
=======================
Access types:
  RO=Read-Only
  RW=Read/Write
  RR=Read/Reset (any write will reset the value to 0)

        the last reset

== Sequencer ==

Reset procedure:
=================
Upon powering up the device the register state must be safely initialized to
sane values. Below is the recommended reset procedure,

     Reg        Value
  1) 0x0004 =   0x0000              Disable all strobe channels
  2) 0x0005 =   0x0000              Disable all delta channels
  3) 0x0003 =   0x0004              Reset counter and event generation
  4) 0x0003 =   0x0000              Unassert reset_counter

To then begin taking data, one might do the following,

     Reg        Value
  5) 0x0004 =   0x0007              Enable all strobe channels
  6) 0x0005 =   0x0007              Enable all delta channels
  7) 0x0003 =   0x0002              Start counter
  8) 0x0003 =   0x0003              Start event generation

To then stop data acquisition, one might,

     Reg        Value
  9) 0x0003 =   0x0002              Disable event generation
