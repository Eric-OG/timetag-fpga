register interface:
====================

The device is controlled using a simple 8-bit register interface. Registers are
manipulated with the read and write commands,

register read:
  byte 0	0xAA
  byte 1        0x00
  byte 2	Register address
  byte 3	0x00

register write:
  byte 0	0xAA
  byte 1        0x01
  byte 2	Register address
  byte 3	Register value

register descriptions:
addr  description
----  -----------
0x01: Version register (RO)
      Gives the hardware version number

0x02: Clockrate register (RO)
      Gives the clockrate in MHz

0x03: Capture control (RW)
  bit		description
  0		capture_operate: Enable registration of input events
  1		counter_operate: Start/stop timestamp counter
  2		reset_counter: Reset counter to 0; counter will remain at 0
		until this bit is manually cleared

0x04: Strobe channel control (RW)
      Each bit enables/disables the corresponding strobe channel

0x05: Delta channel control (RW)
      Each bit enables/disables the corresponding delta channel


Reset procedure:
=================
Upon powering up the device the register state must be safely initialized to
sane values. Below is the recommended reset procedure,

   Reg    Value
1) 0x04 = 0x00          Disable all strobe channels
2) 0x05 = 0x00          Disable all delta channels
3) 0x03 = 0x04          Reset counter and event generation
4) 0x03 = 0x00          Unassert reset_counter

To then begin taking data, one might do the following,

   Reg    Value
5) 0x04 = 0x07          Enable all strobe channels
6) 0x05 = 0x07          Enable all delta channels
7) 0x03 = 0x02          Start counter
8) 0x03 = 0x03          Start event generation
