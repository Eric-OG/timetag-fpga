timetag: An FPGA-based time-tagger implementation
==================================================

Hardware: KNJN Xylo EM

This is an adaptation of the FPGA time-tagging platform written at NIST by
Polyakov, Migdall, and Nam[1]. The code was cleaned up, modularized, and a
register interface was added for configuration. The device is intended to 
record timestamps of certain events on a set of input signals.

The tagging engine has two types of inputs, strobe channels and delta channels.
A strobe channel can be equated to a standard edge trigger, registering an
event on the rising edge of the input signal. This can be used, for instance to
register photon counts from a PMT. Delta channels register any change
(low-to-high or high-to-low) of the input, recording the new state of the input
in the record. The design by default supports up to four channels in strobe
mode and four channels in delta mode, although this can be changed.

See docs/registers for details on using the configuration register interface
and docs/data-format for the structure of produced event records.
